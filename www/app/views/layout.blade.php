        <div class="background_text">Mr. President, I have been here on the floor several times during the past few days over the New Year's weekend, as have the distinguished Republican leader and the distinguished Democratic leader, the distinguished Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], and others who have been working the effort of trying to get this budget back together.", "It is ironic that we are here and we hear statements coming from some, primarily in the other body from back in their home States and home districts, that show to me at least the disconnect with reality. I hope some of these Members when they return to Washington will have a fresh perspective on the human toll this foolish Government shutdown has taken. This foolish Government shutdown has taken a human toll. In fact, it is ironic that the House and Senate cannot seem to come together and get the work done necessary to get us out of this, but we are getting paid at the same time there are hundreds of thousands of Federal employees who want to work and they are not being paid. There are others deemed essential who go to work and will not be paid.", "These people have mortgages. These people have rent, heat, food, child care, everything else, to pay. They are not getting their paychecks. They are real human beings, whether they are in Vermont or any other State.", "My New Year's wish is that the House may replace its severe case of intransigence with some true leadership to get us out of this, because this kind of Government close-down foolishness is not necessary.", "The balanced budget talks are going on right now with the President, with the distinguished leadership on both sides. That has nothing to do with whether Congress completes its work. We have 13 appropriations bills that are supposed to be passed by the end of the fiscal year. The reason much of Government is closed down is because a number of those bills have not been passed. I might suggest a bill that the House could accept, if they are unwilling to pay Federal employees, they ought to pass the bill that the Senate has already passed which says that Members of Congress will not be paid until this is done. They will not do that. In fact, we had one Member of the House who said that he has to be paid because he is in the Constitution. I looked through the Constitution. I did not find his name, and I would love to see which copy he is referring to.", "The fact is that we have people, Federal workers, who are being punished unnecessarily. I would like to have some of these members who do not want us to go back to work to talk to Angelia and Jeffrey Brace of Milton</div>
