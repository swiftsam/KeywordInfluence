	<h3>About the project</h3>

	Keywords of Influence is a data science project completed during my time at <a href='http://thedataincubator.com'>The Data Incubator</a>, a six week data-science bootcamp in NYC. The purpose of the bootcamp is to provide training, mentorship and exposure for PhDs making the transition from academia to industry.  This project is a portfolio product demonstrating some components of my development and analytical abilities.

	<h3>About the data</h3>
	I used two primary sources of data:
	<ul>
		<li>OpenSecrets' campaign finance records</li>
		<li>The Sunlight Foundation's Capitol Words database</li>
	</ul>
