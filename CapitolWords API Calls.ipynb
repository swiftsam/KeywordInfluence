I know that my fellow Senator from Virginia has worked very diligently on the question of trying to resolve this budget impasse.',\n",
        "  u\"But, Mr. President, I would also like to suggest in his very careful comments about the Federal employees, which I do share, we should also bring to the attention of the Senate the severe suffering that has been placed upon the Nation's Capital, the Greater Metropolitan Washington area, composed of the District of Columbia, Virginia, and Maryland, because this area not only houses the Federal Government in large measure, but it also houses so many of the private organizations and institutions that have, as a consequence of this shutdown, been closed. That is bringing about a severe financial crisis here in the Nation's Capital because, as my distinguished colleague knows, tourism is one of the major sources of income in this region. The Commonwealth of Virginia, together with Maryland, provides the facilities for so many of these tourists to stay for whatever period, overnight, or, hopefully several days. It provides the meals and quality of life. That industry is virtually at a standstill.\",\n",
